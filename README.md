The project's primary objective was to compare two distinct approaches for accurately assigning the correct modulation format (MF):
- Predict SNR and Configure MF Accordingly: This approach involved predicting the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and subsequently configuring the modulation format based on the predicted values.
- Direct Classification of MF: In this alternative approach, the project aimed to classify the modulation format directly without an intermediate SNR prediction step.

Two datasets were provided, one specific to Germany and the other encompassing a broader European context. These datasets included information on span lengths and link occupancy.

Additionally, the project explored the technique of Transfer Learning to harness insights from both datasets effectively.

For a comprehensive understanding, a detailed account of the project's pipeline, along with its results, can be found in the "Presentation.pptx" file, where the methodologies and outcomes are thoroughly elucidated.
